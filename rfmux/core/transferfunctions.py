def _general_single_cic_correction(frequencies, f_in, R=64, N=6):
    """
    Compute the single-stage CIC (Cascaded Integrator-Comb) filter correction factor.

    CIC filters exhibit passband droop, especially at higher frequencies. This function
    calculates a correction factor to approximately compensate for that droop. The
    correction factor is derived analytically based on the idealized mathematical
    expressions for a CIC filter. However, in firmware implementations, the filter
    coefficients are quantized, so the actual correction will not be perfectly exact,
    but will still be quite close.

    The datapath for the CRS includes two different CIC filters, with the second stage
    having a variable decimation rate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequencies : ndarray
        Frequency bins (in Hz) for which the correction factor is desired. Typically
        these might be FFT bin centers or some other set of discrete frequencies at
        which droop compensation is needed.
    f_in : float
        Input (pre-decimation) sampling rate in Hz. This is the rate at which data
        enters the CIC filter before it is decimated.
    R : int, optional
        The decimation rate. Default is 64.
    N : int, optional
        The number of CIC stages (integrator-comb pairs). Default is 6.

    Returns
    -------
    correction : ndarray
        Array of correction values (dimensionless, same shape as `frequencies`) that can
        be multiplied by the frequency response (or by the time-domain samples after
        the CIC filter) to approximately correct for the droop introduced by the filter.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The correction factor is computed using the ratio of sinc functions raised to
       the power of N:

       .. math::
          H_{corr}(\\omega) =
              \\left(
                  \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\pi f / f_{in}\\right)}
                       {\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi f}{R f_{in}}\\right)}
              \\right)^N
              \\times \\frac{1}{R^N}

       where :math:`f` is the frequency, :math:`f_{in}` is the input sample rate,
       :math:`R` is the decimation ratio, and :math:`N` is the number of stages.

    2. At DC (0 Hz), the expression above has an indeterminate form
       :math:`0/0`. We replace those NaN values with the ideal DC gain of
       :math:`R^N`, then normalize by :math:`R^N`, effectively making the
       correction factor 1 at DC.

    3. In practical hardware/firmware implementations, the CIC coefficients may be
       quantized or truncated, which means that the filter's actual response can deviate
       slightly from the ideal model used here. Therefore, the computed correction
       factor is an approximation that should perform well but will not be absolutely
       precise.

                        Corresponds to crs.UNITS.ADC_COUNTS.

    """
    Bin a noise PSD using exponential bin sizes.
    
    This is a visual aid for cleaner plotting of noise spectra. The exponential
    binning is not statistically rigorous but provides a cleaner visualization
    of noise floors while preserving spectral features.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    f : array-like
        Frequency data in Hz
    psd : array-like
        Power spectral density data (same shape as f)
    nbins : int, optional
        Number of bins to use (default: 1000)
        
    Returns
    -------
    fbinned : np.ndarray
        Binned frequency data (geometric mean of bin edges)
    psd_binned : np.ndarray
        Binned PSD data (mean of points in each bin)

    '''
    Equation 4.5 of Pete Barry's thesis (https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/71562/1/2014BarryPPhD.pdf)
    Converts from I,Q voltage units to fequency shift and dissipation.

    NOTE This assumes linearity over the dynamic range being exercised.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    iq : numpy array
        complex I+jQ data in voltage units. Note that this can be an I,Q timestream or an FFT of an I,Q
        timestream 

    fbias : float
        resonant frequency (or, frequency at which to compute the derivatives used in the conversion)

    f_calsweep : arraylike
        array of frequency data from the sweep 

    iq_calsweep : arraylike
        array of I+jQ values from the sweep IN VOLTAGE UNITS, corresponding to f_calsweep

    Returns:
    --------

    df : numpy array
        the converted data, in the format (ffs)+1j*(diss) where ffs is frequency shift (NOT fractional frequency shift)
        and diss is dissipative. To get fractional frequency shift, divide by fbias.
