## Usage

### Command-Line
After installing the package with `pip install .` in the repository:
```bash
periscope <crs_board> [options]
```

Or directly as a Python module:
```bash
python -m rfmux.tools.periscope <crs_board> [options]
```

The CRS board identifier can be specified in three formats:
- A hostname in the format rfmux####.local (e.g., "rfmux0042.local")
- Just the serial number (e.g., "0042")
- A direct IP address (e.g., "192.168.2.100")

Options:
- `--module <module_num>`: Specify the module number (default: 1)
- `--channels <channel_spec>`: Channel specification, where multiple channels can be grouped with '&' and separated with ',' (default: "1")
- `--buffer <size>`: Buffer size for data acquisition (default: 5000)
- `--refresh <ms>`: GUI refresh interval in milliseconds (default: 33)
- `--dot-px <size>`: Dot diameter in pixels for IQ density display (default: 1)

Examples:
```bash
# Using hostname format
periscope rfmux0022.local --module 2 --channels "3&5,7"

# Using just the serial number
periscope 0022 --module 2 --channels "3&5,7"

# Using IP address
periscope 192.168.2.100 --module 2 --channels "3&5,7"
```

### Programmatic (e.g., in IPython/Jupyter)
```python
from rfmux.tools.periscope import raise_periscope
from rfmux import CRS # Assuming CRS object is obtained elsewhere

# Example usage:
crs_instance = CRS(...) 
await crs_instance.resolve() # If needed
await raise_periscope(crs_instance, module=2, channels="3&5")
```

## Key Features

### Network Analysis

The network analysis functionality allows for detailed characterization of resonators:

1. Click "Network Analyzer" to configure and run a frequency sweep
2. Set frequency range, sweep points, and amplitude parameters
3. View amplitude and phase response for each module
4. Use "Find Resonances" to automatically identify resonance frequencies
5. Use "Unwrap Cable Delay" to compensate for cable length effects
6. Export data in various formats for further analysis

### Multisweep Analysis

For high-resolution analysis around identified resonance frequencies:

1. First identify resonances using the Network Analysis feature
2. Click "Take Multisweep" to configure a detailed sweep around resonances
3. Analyze detector parameters and characteristics
4. Export data for detailed offline analysis

### Import and Export Data
Periscope provides several ways to reuse previously captured sweeps and to archive new measurements for offline study.

- **Network analysis parameter import**
  1. In the *Network Analysis* dialog, select **Import Data** to load a saved configuration from a `.pkl`/`.pickle` file created by an earlier run.
  2. The dialog non-blockingly opens a file chooser and, once a compatible payload is selected, pre-populates all sweep parameters (modules, amplitudes, frequency span, averaging, cable length, etc.).
  3. After the file is validated, the **Load Analysis** button becomes available, allowing you to immediately reuse the imported settings without re-entering them by hand.
  4. If the resonance values are available it will also re-plot the data in the same way as displayed when it was saved.

- **Network analysis data export**
  1. In the Network Analysis window toolbar, **Export Data** opens a save dialog where you can choose Pickle (`.pkl`) or CSV (`.csv`). The picker is non-blocking so live acquisition continues once the dialog is dismissed.
  2. Pickle exports contain a timestamp, the exact sweep parameters used, and a hierarchy of per-module measurements. For every sweep Periscope stores the raw frequency grid, magnitude in counts/volts/dBm (both raw and normalized), phase in degrees, the complex IQ samples, and any resonances that were identified.
  3. If find resonance was executed, the exported file will also contain resonance frequencies.

- **Multisweep import**
  1. When launching a multisweep with "Load Multisweep" enabled, use the **Import Sweep File** button to choose a previously exported multisweep results file (`.pkl`/`.pickle`).
  2. The dialog loads the saved parameters, resonance list, and fitted frequencies. You can toggle whether to seed the run with raw sweep targets or with the fitted center frequencies captured in the file, and the amplitude and sweep settings are filled in automatically.
  3. If no file is provided one can input frequencies manually and start the sweep.


- **Multisweep data export**
  1. The Multisweep window includes an **Export Data** button that writes a  pickle file. The export captures the timestamp, module ID, initial parameters, DAC scales in use, per-iteration results, and any Bias-KIDs analysis outputs so that complete runs can be replayed or shared.
  2. One can again export the file from Multisweep window after setting bias. Now the Bias-KIDs output will not be empty.

- **Load Bias**
  1. Use **Load Bias** from the main toolbar to apply bias settings generated by a previous multisweep and Bias-KIDs solve. The dialog accepts pickle
    exports containing `initial_parameters`, DAC scale metadata, and `bias_kids_output` results.
  2. When a compatible file is selected, Periscope validates the payload and populates the module, tone list, amplitudes, and span fields. You can edit these values before committing them, or load them exactly as saved. The application programs the CRS with the stored amplitudes, tones, and phases and warns when board DAC scales diverge from the file so you can reconcile units before biasing.
  3. Files missing the expected structure are rejected with a clear warning so you do not accidentally apply partial or incompatible bias information.

- **Take Noise** 
  1. Opening the Detector Digest on a resonance also provides a **Take Noise** shortcut. The digest overlays the newly acquired noise timestream with the loaded rotation data, letting you confirm phase alignment, biasing and overall noise behavior without rerunning the full sweep. One can click it multiple times to see the evolution of noise in their data stream.
  2. Noise captures are tied to the currently selected detector, making it straightforward to iterate on the bias solution and immediately see the impact on the detectorâ€™s timestream statistics.

All import dialogs validate that the selected file contains the expected data structure and will notify you if a file is missing required sections, helping prevent accidental misuse of unrelated files

### Display Customization

Multiple customization options are available:

- Toggle between dark and light themes
- Select which plot types to display
- Choose between raw counts and real units (volts, dBm)
- Enable/disable auto-scaling for more focused analysis
- Group multiple channels for comparative visualization

## Development

When extending or modifying Periscope:

1. Follow the established coding style and patterns
2. Utilize the task system for background processing
3. Keep UI operations on the main thread
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
5. Maintain consistent documentation and type annotations

See the Memory Bank system patterns documentation for detailed coding guidelines.
